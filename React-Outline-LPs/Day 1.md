## Day 1: Introduction to React & JSX (5 hours)
Learning Objectives:

Understand what React is and why it's used.

Set up a basic React development environment.

Grasp JSX syntax and its role in React.

Create and render simple React components.

```
store new components in src/components
```

### Concepts Explained:

- What is React?

- Declarative vs. Imperative programming.

- Component-based architecture.

- Virtual DOM.

- Setting up a React Project:

- Introduction to Create React App (CRA) or Vite (recommended for speed).

- Project structure (src, public, node_modules).

- JSX (JavaScript XML):

- Syntax rules (single root element, camelCase for attributes, className).

- Embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX ({}).

- Rendering lists with map (brief introduction).

### Components:

- Functional components (the modern way).

- Rendering components in App.js.

- Passing static props (properties) to components.

### Examples:

- Hello World Component: A simple App.js showing "Hello, React!".

- Basic JSX Rules: Demonstrate className, self-closing tags, and embedding variables.

- Greeting Component: Create a Greeting component that accepts a name prop and displays "Hello, [name]!".

### Exercises::

- Personal Info Card: Create a component that displays your name, age, and a short bio using props.

- Simple Header/Footer: Build a basic page layout with separate Header and Footer components.

- JSX Playground: Experiment with different JSX expressions (arithmetic, string concatenation) directly in a component.

- Key Takeaways: React uses a component-based approach and JSX for UI definition. Components are reusable building blocks.
